# Falldown
Simple app using IONIC and Phaser, similar to falldown seen on TI-83 calculations

This game was built upon the phaser framework and then embeded into an app that using Ionic. 

The game was built to test the responsiveness of the combination of Inonic and Phaser before devloping a larger game. The result is substaintial lag on my HTC one.
